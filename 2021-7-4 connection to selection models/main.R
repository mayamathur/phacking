# Goal: I think that if I analyze only the *affirmatives*, the weightr package and LTN should coincide if I tell weightr that eta=infinity and all studies have same SE (because LTN doesnâ€™t yet give us a way to handle different SEs). See if this is true. 

# Overall purpose is to see when selection models will work under p-hacking.
